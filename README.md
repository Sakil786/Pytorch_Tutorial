# Pytorch_Tutorial
### Introduction
Deep learning has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence, allowing machines to learn and make decisions from complex data.  In this repo, we'll embark on a journey through the code for building a Neural Network using PyTorch. Let's break down the provided code line by line to demystify the process.

# Line-by-Line Explanation:
```python
1. import torch
2. import torch.nn as nn
```
These lines import the necessary libraries. torch is the core library for tensor computations, and torch.nn provides tools for building neural networks.
