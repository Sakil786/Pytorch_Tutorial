### Introduction
Deep learning has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence, allowing machines to learn and make decisions from complex data.  In this repo, we'll embark on a journey through the code for building a Neural Network using PyTorch. Let's break down the provided code line by line to demystify the process.

# Line-by-Line Explanation:
```python
1. import torch
2. import torch.nn as nn
```
These lines import the necessary libraries. torch is the core library for tensor computations, and torch.nn provides tools for building neural networks.

```python
4. class Model(nn.Module):
5.     def __init__(self):
6.         super().__init__()
7.         self.layer1 = nn.Linear(128, 32)
8.         self.layer2 = nn.Linear(32, 16)
9.         self.layer3 = nn.Linear(16, 1)

```
Here, we define a class named Model that inherits from nn.Module, the base class for all PyTorch models. The __init__ method initializes the model's layers. We have three linear layers (nn.Linear), representing the input layer (128 nodes), a hidden layer (32 nodes), another hidden layer (16 nodes), and the output layer (1 node).

```python
11.     def forward(self, features):
12.         x = self.layer1(features)
13.         x = self.layer2(x)
14.         x = self.layer3(x)
15.         return x

```
The forward method defines the forward pass of the model. It takes input features and passes them through each layer. This is the essence of how neural networks make predictions â€” by transforming input data through a series of interconnected layers.
```python
17. if __name__ == '__main__':
18.     model = Model()
19.     features = torch.randn((2, 128))
20.     model(features)

```
In the main block, we create an instance of the Model class. We generate random input features (torch.randn((2, 128))) for demonstration purposes. Finally, we pass these features through the model using model(features) to observe the output.
